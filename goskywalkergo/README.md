# goskywalkergo

basically like-for-like functionality but in go. maps aren't ordered so output is different(extremely ugly)

pathetic code but brute-forced my way through to make it work, yay first go program. TON'S of major issues with types/etc on go and python version, unchecked. time to read a go book before building anything else (next year?)

DO NOT USE THIS!!!

don't taze me bro.
